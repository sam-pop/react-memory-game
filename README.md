# react-memory-game

## Welcome to "Fun with (red) flags"!

The goal of this memory game is to pick all the flags (from the flags that are displayed on the screen) one by one - BUT you can only pick each flag once!

If you can pick all 9 flags without picking the same one twice - you are the WINNER!

Mumbling to yourself "THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME" ? Don't worry, you can always try
again ðŸ˜‰.

## What I used

This game was built using [React JS](https://reactjs.org/).
